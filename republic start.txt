Good to meet you in person. Please, sit," he says, gesturing to the chair next to you before taking a seat behind his desk. "We'll get right to it. As you might know, the nuclear detonation on Geminus means we're... well, stretched thin. We've been hiring contractors to fill gaps in our manpower, and you've proved you're reliable.

I've prepared a few agents disguised as colonists to infiltrate the planet and arrest the pirate, but I've hit a roadblock: transportation. Any port authority would never let a Navy ship land, so I need an alternative. That's where you come in.

The funding's one of those 'spend it or lose it' situations, so I really don't mind. Second, if you perform well on this mission, I may have future work lined up with more concrete rewards. For the time being, I need to see how you do before I decide spending more money is worth it. Any more questions?"`

			`	"The moon with the mines? The miners might not notice nuclear detonations on the surface, but it'd be hard to miss if you're in the area, and irradiated rock is easy to spot if you're lookingfor it. And testing inside the mines would be ridiculous. They couldn't have actually done it there." One of the captains says, sceptically.`
			`	"Did this come from the same source that told you there are aliens in the Deep, ensign?" Another says, with a hint of a smile.`
			`	"No, sir, that came from somewhere else, and hasn't actually been disproven." He responds, smiling as well.`

			`	She nods, and begins explaining, "It's my job to make sure that the new shipyard is up to at least the same standards as the old one. It's not just about making sure that the original plans and specifications are followed, many of those are decades old by now. In that time, numerous upgrades were made to the facilities and systems. And then there's the smaller changes made by the people actually working here. We don't want to build a new shipyard that has all the same little issues and inefficiencies that were corrected in the old one in the years since it was built."`
			`	"That sounds like important work. How are you going to find out about all those changes?" You ask.`
			`	"Fortunately, many of those changes were documented, that information just isn't necessarily stored where the original plans were. And I've also been talking to as many of the people who have worked here as I can to fill in the gaps. It's a lot of work, but it'll mean we have the best shipyard possible."`

No one else in human space builds warships that big.
